# RoboCrypto - Technical Specifications

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI for UI development
- Swift 5.0+ for backend logic
- MVVM architecture pattern
- Combine framework for reactive programming
- Core Data for portfolio persistence
- URLSession for networking
- Swift Charts for data visualization

## Development Methods
1. **Architecture**
   - MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern
   - Protocol-oriented programming
   - Dependency injection
   - Reactive programming with Combine
   - Modular feature organization

2. **UI Development**
   - SwiftUI for declarative UI
   - Custom view modifiers
   - Responsive layouts
   - Dark/Light mode support
   - Custom color theming system

3. **Data Management**
   - RESTful API integration via URLSession
   - JSON parsing with Codable
   - Core Data for local storage
   - Image caching with NSCache
   - Error handling with custom types

## Coding Standards
1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Use camelCase for variables and functions
   - Use PascalCase for types and protocols
   - Prefix private properties with underscore
   - Use descriptive names
   - Follow Swift API Design Guidelines

2. **Code Organization**
   - Feature-based module structure
   - Protocol-oriented design
   - Extension-based functionality
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Clear documentation

3. **SwiftUI Best Practices**
   - Use @State for view-specific state
   - Use @StateObject for view model instances
   - Implement preview providers
   - Use environment objects for shared state
   - Modular view composition

## Database Design
- Core Data for portfolio persistence
- In-memory caching for performance
- Image caching system
- Data model relationships:
  - CoinModel (core data)
  - CoinDetailModel (detailed info)
  - MarketDataModel (market stats)
  - StatisticModel (metrics)
  - Portfolio (user data)

## Error Handling
- Custom error types
- Result type for operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Error logging system
- Network error handling
- Data validation

  - Models
  - ViewModels
  - Services
  - Extensions
- UI tests for:
  - Critical user flows
  - View interactions
  - Navigation
- Integration tests for:
  - API calls
  - Data persistence
  - Service interactions
- Performance testing:
  - Image loading
